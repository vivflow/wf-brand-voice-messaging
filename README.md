# Webflow Brand Voice — Claude Code Skill

This repo contains a skill for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) that teaches Claude how Webflow writes. Once installed, you can ask Claude to write, edit, or review any content in Webflow's voice — and it'll know the rules.

---

## What is a skill?

A skill is a markdown file that gives Claude Code a set of instructions to follow. Drop it in the right folder, and Claude will use it automatically when it's relevant, or whenever you ask.

---

## Installation

### Claude Code

**1. Copy the skill file into your project:**

```bash
your-project/
└── .claude/
    └── skills/
        └── webflow-brand-voice.md   ← copy this file here
```

That's it. Claude Code will pick it up automatically.

**2. (Optional) Copy the reference files too:**

The skill references two supporting files for deeper guidance. If you want Claude to use them, copy the `references/` folder into your project as well:

```bash
your-project/
└── .claude/
    └── skills/
        ├── webflow-brand-voice.md
        └── references/
            ├── tone-by-surface.md
            └── inclusive-language.md
```

### Claude Chat

**1. Download this repo as a ZIP:**

On this GitHub page, click the green **Code** button → **Download ZIP**, then extract it on your computer.

**2. Upload the files in Claude Chat:**

Upload the files to Claude > Settings > Customize > Skills: [[claude.ai]([https://claude.ai](https://claude.ai/customize/skills)),:](https://claude.ai/customize/skills)

- **Minimum:** `.claude/skills/webflow-brand-voice.md`
- **Recommended:** add `references/tone-by-surface.md` and `references/inclusive-language.md` for fuller guidance

**3. Ask Claude to use the guidelines:**

Once uploaded, Claude will have the brand voice rules in context for that conversation. You can say something like:

> "I've uploaded Webflow's brand voice guidelines. Please use them for everything I ask you to write or edit in this conversation."

---

## How to use it

Once the skill is installed, just ask Claude naturally. Some examples:

> "Write a LinkedIn post about our new Localization feature."

> "Edit this blog intro so it sounds more like Webflow."

> "Does this ad copy match our brand voice? What's off?"

> "Draft a support response for a customer who can't find the CMS."

You can also be explicit: **"Use Webflow's voice"**, **"write like Webflow"**, or **"check this against our brand guidelines"**.
